# Supernova Verifier

A zkVerify pallet verifier for the Supernova proof system using the Pasta curve.

This Substrate pallet is designed to integrate with zkVerify and validate zero-knowledge proofs generated by Supernova. It serves as a modular verifier that can be plugged into any Substrate-based blockchain runtime.

## Features

- Verifies Supernova proofs on-chain
- Built for zkVerify integration
- Uses Pasta curve for cryptographic operations
- Modular and runtime-friendly
